# --- LINKER CONFIGURATION ---
# Linking is usually the bottleneck for incremental builds.

# Windows users:
# The default MSVC linker is slow. If you have `lld` installed (via LLVM), 
# you can uncomment the block below for speed.
# [target.x86_64-pc-windows-msvc]
# linker = "lld-link"

# Linux users:
# 'mold' is significantly faster than standard ld.
# [target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
# linker = "clang"
# rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=mold"]

# macOS users:
# 'zld' is a faster alternative if installed via brew.
# [target.x86_64-apple-darwin]
# rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=zld"]
# [target.aarch64-apple-darwin]
# rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=zld"]
